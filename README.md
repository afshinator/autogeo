Automated [Geomantic Divination] & Interpretation.

Geomantic divination was for hundreds of years practiced by people from all social classes throughout Europe (especially prized by the ruling classes and the Church - until they outlawed it for commoners to use), Asia, and Africa.  While most people have heard of its Chinese counterpart, the [Yi Jing] (I Ching), this version has largely escaped attention in the modern world.

This program automates the manual process of casting a session, and also helps interpret the results; however, its no substitute for a knowledgable practitioner - but should be fun to play with nontheless!
