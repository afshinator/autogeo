### What does it do?


Automates a divination session.  Classical Geomantic divination uses 
lines drawn on sand or paper to generate the letters from which meanings are
driven.   This program lets you either enter already-derived letters, or
generate a session from scratch by tapping the space-bar in place of drawing
lines.

Various classic interpretations are given.

You can also use the geolocation feature to generate the 'Heavenly Rulers' if
you wish that style.


See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomancy
for a general intro to the art.
