  <h5>The nature or type of the question being asked in divination can also be associated with one of 7 astrological planets; below are some of those associations.</h5>
  <p>Cross reference this info with the <strong>Time transits and Rulers</strong> table to see when in the day that planet 'rules.' - these are the best times that day to ask that kind of question.<br>Each weekday is also ruled by a specific planet, so there is even a best day of the week (with its own best hours) that is a favored time.</p>
